## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommemcpserver.git
cd ecommemcpserver
```

2. Build the project

```bash

```

## Configuration

The MCP server is configured in `application.yml`:

- Server runs on port 8081
- Server name: examplemcpserver
- Synchronous communication mode
- Supports STDIO transport for terminal-based communication
- Exposes `/mcp/sse` and `/mcp/sse/message` endpoints for SSE communication
- H2 database console available at `/h2-console`

## Database Configuration

### H2 In-Memory Database
- **URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: `password`
- **Console Access**: `http://localhost:8081/h2-console`

- `get_books_by_year` - Get books published in a specific year
- `get_books_by_price_range` - Get books within a price range

### Analytics Tools
- `get_library_stats` - Get comprehensive library statistics

### Additional Tools
- Mathematical operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`
- Date manipulation tools

## Testing with MCP Inspector

You can use the MCP Inspector client to test and interact with your MCP server:

### Prerequisites

1. Install the MCP Inspector globally:
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

### Connecting to the Server

1. Start the MCP server:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

2. In a new terminal, launch the MCP Inspector:
```bash
mcp-inspector
```

3. Connect to your server using the SSE transport:
   - **Transport Type**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - **URL**: `http://localhost:8081/mcp/sse`
   - **Server Name**: examplemcpserver

4. Once connected, you'll see all available tools in the Inspector interface

### Using the Inspector Interface

The MCP Inspector provides a user-friendly interface to:

- **View Available Tools**: Browse all 16 registered tools including book management, math, and date tools
- **Inspect Tool Schemas**: See parameter requirements and descriptions for each tool
- **Execute Tools**: Run tools with proper parameter validation
- **View Responses**: See formatted responses from tool executions
- **Monitor Real-time**: Watch for server notifications and updates

## Usage with AI Clients (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

### ðŸ¤– **The Power of AI Integration**

This MCP server transforms your book management into a **conversational AI experience**. Instead of using traditional interfaces, you can simply talk to AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or other MCP-compatible clients using natural language:

**Example Conversations:**
- *"Add Clean Architecture by Robert Martin to my library"*
- *"Show me all books by authors with 'Martin' in their name"*
- *"What's the most expensive book in my collection?"*
- *"Find books published between 2010 and 2020 under $30"*

### Claude Desktop Integration

Configure this server in Claude Desktop by adding to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "books-management-server": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.stdio=true",
        "-Dspring.main.web-application-type=none",
        "-Dlogging.pattern.console=",
        "-jar",
        "path/to/examplemcpserver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

This server is compatible with any MCP-enabled client:
- **Claude Desktop**: Most popular choice with excellent MCP support
- **Continue.dev**: VS Code extension for AI-powered development
- **Custom MCP Clients**: Build your own using the MCP SDK
- **Web Clients**: Connect via SSE endpoints for browser-based interactions

### ðŸŒŸ **Why This Is Powerful**

1. **Natural Language Interface**: No need to remember specific API calls or commands
2. **Context Awareness**: AI understands your intent and chooses the right tools
3. **Complex Queries**: Combine multiple operations in a single conversation
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected in your database
5. **Error Handling**: AI provides helpful feedback when operations fail

### ðŸš€ **Real-World AI Scenarios**

#### Scenario 1: Library Discovery
```
You: "What programming books do I have?"
Claude: I'll search your library for programming books.
[Uses search_books_by_name with "programming" and related terms]
Claude: "You have 4 programming books: Clean Code ($45.99), Design Patterns ($54.99), Effective Java ($49.99), and Spring in Action ($52.99)."
```

#### Scenario 2: Smart Recommendations
```
You: "I liked Clean Code. What similar books do I have?"
Claude: Let me check for other books by Robert Martin or similar topics.
[Uses search_books_by_author("Robert") and analyzes your collection]
Claude: "You also have Clean Architecture by the same author, Robert C. Martin, published in 2017 for $47.99."
```

#### Scenario 3: Library Management
```
You: "Add the latest book on microservices architecture, priced around $40"
Claude: I'll add that book to your library.
[Uses add_book with the details provided]
Claude: "I've added 'Microservices Architecture' to your library. The book is now available in your collection."
```

#### Scenario 4: Analytics & Insights
```
You: "Give me a summary of my book collection"
Claude: Let me analyze your library statistics.
[Uses get_library_stats and get_all_books for detailed analysis]
Claude: "Your library contains 21 books spanning from 1813 to 2021, with prices ranging from $10.99 to $54.99. You have a great mix of classic literature, sci-fi, and technical books!"
```
